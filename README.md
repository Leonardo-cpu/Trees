#   Native trees from the North American deserts.

Hello everyone. I hope you are having a wonderful day.
I will use this repository on GitHub I created to share PDF files I made myself talking about the Native trees that can be planted in desert cities in the United States and Mexico. All the information is on English and Spanish.

This is a project I do for fun and also to inform people in both countries about which kind of trees are appropiate for these type of climates.

Any feedback is accepted to improve this project.

January 28 2025. As of now, I have completed 6 documents. I will post more in the following days on my free time from classes.
